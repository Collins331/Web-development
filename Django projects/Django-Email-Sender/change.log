Previously:
- The project used Python 3.7
- The code to send the email was present in "email_proj" app.
- The endpoint was http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
- It made use of Google "Less secure app access" option of the Google Account. Google has now disabled this option as part of security measures.

In this version:
- Updated Python to v3.8
- The Django app name is updated from "email_proj" to "email_sender_app"
- Updated endpoint to from http://127.0.0.1:8000/api to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/send-mail
- Added TODO comments so that its easy to identify where the developer has to make changes
- Updated README with steps to use Google App password instead of "Less secure app access" of Google.
- Removed unnecessary imports and comments and added .gitignore file
